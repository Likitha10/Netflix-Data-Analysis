# üìä Netflix Dataset SQL Analysis

## üìå Introduction
This project explores the Netflix dataset available on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shivamb/netflix-shows?resource=download) using **advanced SQL queries**. The analysis provides valuable business insights into content distribution, trends, and patterns on Netflix.

The project is structured to demonstrate **data exploration, transformations, and analytical skills** with SQL. The queries cover **aggregations, window functions, string manipulations, and common table expressions (CTEs)** to extract meaningful insights.
